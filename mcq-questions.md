D) Logging errors without responding to users  

**Answer: B**

---

### Question 9
What is the purpose of input validation in AI API endpoints?

A) To slow down the system  
B) To ensure incoming data meets required formats and constraints before processing  
C) To increase memory usage  
D) To make the code more complex  

**Answer: B**

---

### Question 10
What is the advantage of using environment variables for API configuration?
