# Multi-Task LLM API Development - Question Description

## Overview

Build a comprehensive Flask-based REST API that provides multiple AI-powered services including text generation, code generation, and text classification using Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model. This project focuses on creating a production-ready API with proper error handling, rate limiting, documentation, and robust retry mechanisms for handling external AI service dependencies.

## Project Objectives

1. **Multi-Endpoint API Design:** Create a well-structured REST API with distinct endpoints for different AI tasks, each optimized for specific use cases with appropriate model configurations.

2. **Production-Ready Architecture:** Implement comprehensive production features including rate limiting, CORS support, error handling, logging, and retry mechanisms with exponential backoff.

3. **AI Service Integration:** Master integration with Google's Gemini AI through LangChain, implementing proper authentication, error handling, and service reliability patterns.

4. **API Documentation and Testing:** Build comprehensive API documentation using Swagger/OpenAPI and implement thorough testing strategies including unit tests and integration tests.

5. **Reliability and Resilience:** Design robust systems that handle external service failures, rate limiting, and network issues gracefully with proper retry logic and fallback mechanisms.

6. **Performance Optimization:** Implement efficient request handling, appropriate model configurations for different tasks, and proper resource management for scalable deployments.

## Key Features to Implement

- Multiple specialized endpoints for text generation, code generation, and text classification with task-specific optimizations
- Comprehensive rate limiting system with configurable limits per endpoint and user to prevent abuse
- Advanced retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for handling API rate limits and temporary failures
- Full Swagger/OpenAPI documentation with interactive testing interface and comprehensive endpoint descriptions
- Robust error handling with proper HTTP status codes, detailed error messages, and logging
- CORS support for cross-origin requests with configurable security settings for different deployment environments

## Challenges and Learning Points

- **API Architecture:** Understanding RESTful design principles, endpoint organization, and proper HTTP status code usage for different scenarios
- **External Service Integration:** Learning to handle unreliable external APIs with proper retry logic, timeout handling, and error recovery
- **Rate Limiting and Security:** Implementing effective rate limiting strategies, CORS policies, and API security best practices
- **Testing Strategies:** Developing comprehensive testing approaches for APIs that depend on external services, including mocking and integration testing
- **Production Deployment:** Understanding deployment considerations including logging, monitoring, error tracking, and scalability requirements
- **Documentation and Developer Experience:** Creating clear, comprehensive API documentation that enables easy integration and testing
- **Reliability Engineering:** Building resilient systems that gracefully handle failures and provide consistent service availability

## Expected Outcome

You will create a production-ready multi-task AI API that demonstrates professional API development practices, robust error handling, and effective integration with external AI services. The API will be fully documented, thoroughly tested, and ready for deployment in production environments.

## Additional Considerations

- Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms for secure API access
- Add support for batch processing and asynchronous task handling for large requests
- Create monitoring and analytics capabilities for tracking API usage and performance
- Implement caching strategies to optimize response times and reduce external API calls
- Add support for different AI models and providers with configurable model selection
- Create webhook support for long-running tasks and real-time notifications
- Consider implementing API versioning strategies for backward compatibility and evolution
